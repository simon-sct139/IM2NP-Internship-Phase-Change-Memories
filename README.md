## üìã Project Overview

This research internship focused on **multi-physics simulation** using **COMSOL Multiphysics** to model the thermal phenomena involved in the operation of next-generation non-volatile memories. The core objective was to simulate the laser pulse heating of multilayer structures based on **Ge‚ÇÇSb‚ÇÇTe‚ÇÖ (GST)** and related phase-change materials to understand the thermal conditions required for the **amorphous-to-crystalline phase transition**.

The model accounted for heat propagation through complex material stacks, including a TiN surface layer and a silicon substrate, with the goal of optimizing the energy efficiency and reliability of PCM devices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach & Skills Demonstrated

### **Software & Tools**
*   **COMSOL Multiphysics:** Primary environment for building and solving the finite element model.

### **Modeling & Physics**
*   **Geometry & Meshing:** Designed the 2D/3D geometry of the multilayer stack and performed mesh convergence studies to ensure result accuracy.
*   **Heat Transfer Module:** Implemented and solved the Heat Equation with appropriate boundary conditions (thermal insulation, heat flux from laser source).
*   **Material Properties:** Defined temperature-dependent thermal properties (conductivity, heat capacity) for the different materials.
*   **Parametric Studies:** Systematically varied laser parameters (power, pulse duration) to map their effect on the temperature distribution and identify the phase transition window.

### **Analysis & Output**
*   Quantified key metrics: maximum temperature reached in the active layer, heating/cooling rates, and thermal gradients.
*   Visualized results: 2D/3D temperature distribution plots, time-temperature profiles, and comparative charts.

## üìä Weekly Progress & Presentations

A key part of the internship involved weekly presentations to the research team to discuss progress, results, and next steps. This practice was essential for receiving feedback and guiding the project's direction.

## üöÄ Competencies Developed

*   **Scientific Computing:** Advanced proficiency in **COMSOL Multiphysics** for multi-physics simulation.
*   **Technical Communication:** Regularly presented complex technical work to an expert audience, honing my ability to explain and defend my methodology.
*   **Research Best Practices:** Learned to manage a complex project timeline, iterate based on feedback, and work within a collaborative research environment.
